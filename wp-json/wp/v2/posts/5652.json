One of the main limitations is its intermittent nature, as solar power generation depends on sunlight availability. Energy storage technologies, such as batteries, are being developed to address this challenge. Additionally, the initial installation cost of solar systems can be relatively high, although it is often offset by long-term energy savings.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Solar Thermal Systems: Solar thermal systems use sunlight to heat water or other fluids.
